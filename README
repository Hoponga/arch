The current version of the MIPS processor is in the problem directory (aptly named). I created custom makefile targets to compile & simulate it with Icarus & Verilator: 

To compile, run `make ibuild` and to simulate, run `make isim`

At the start of simulation, the desired program hex data is loaded into the mips_mem.v memory module's text segment. To change what program to run, just change the input .x file in mips_mem.v (somewhere around line 230)

The mips -> hex parser is still work in progress, so in the meantime I use this website to convert my code to hex: http://www.kurtm.net/archive/2004-Summer-cs61c-public_html/mipsasm/index.cgi
